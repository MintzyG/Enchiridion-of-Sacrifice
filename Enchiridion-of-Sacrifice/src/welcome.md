You caved... It means your sanity finally perished, could no longer dominate the thousand voices screaming in your head... Beggin for life, beggin to be reborn, beggin... for mercy... 
</br>
We are merciful, after all, and could extend you a courtesy... listened to you painful cries, tears drowned in despair. Lament no more, my beautiful naive sorcerer, your soul is already binded to this book, binded to us... Reach out for us... fight for us, and we shall aid you in reaching your zenith, or perish.
